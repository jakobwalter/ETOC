Accompanying code to my thesis: Exact Testing of RNA-Seq Data

The Thesis can be found in the main folder.
In the folder "reports" there are two R-Markdown files:
- "InitialDataAnalysis", which contains the code to download the TCGA-LIHC Data. Runnung on all methods on this data and the code to obtain the analysis, visualization and material up to Section 6.2 of the Thesis
- "SimulationStudy" which contains the simulation study, i.e. the code for section 6.2 and 6.3.

Furthermore, some helper functions are in the folder functions. All plots from the thesis are in "plots" and all data - including the results of the simulation study - are in data.
